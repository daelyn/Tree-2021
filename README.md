# Tree-2021


## Inspiration
During the Pandemic, we wanted to socialize with our friends and partners, watch movies, party , etc.
But due to the Lockdown, we were locked in the four walls of our Home. We know the importance of connections in the world , so we thought to create an app through which we can watch movies of our interest with the people we love.
## What it does
Movie-Demic is a movie-choice based dating application which can suggest matches on the basis of movies we love. The type of Movies we watch describes the type of person we are and we always want to be with the one, who has similar interests as us. ALong with being a dating application it will even have the feature to watch movies with friends and family. 
In Movie-Demic , We have to select our favourite genres using which, it will show us movies and we have to swipe left if we dislike the movie and swipe right if we like a movie and based on our likes and dislikes, it will show us Profiles of people which have interests similar to ours. We can send request and if we make a match then we can binge watch together while chatting.
## How we built it
Movie-Demic is made using Android Studio, Google Firebase, Swipecards (GitHub), Figma and coded using JAVA to make it a user-friendly Dating/Movie watching app.
## Challenges we ran into
Since we all are beginners, and it was the first time we were building an android app. The first challenges was to choose a languages in which we can code and then, next challenge was to create swiping slides which we luckily found on GitHub and other challenges were to learn JAVA and how to make an android app, how to use Google Firebase, how to arrange activities in Android Studio.
The biggest challenge were the processors of our laptops which were stopping us from using Android Studio by hanging at different times.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We now, at least, know how to use Android Studio, Google Firebase, Figma and now we have friends with whom we share interests and look forward to meet each other in person someday.
